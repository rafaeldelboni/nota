# Developers
Commands and alias for tooling while developing nota.

## Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Set configurations
Set the [`resources/config.edn`](https://github.com/rafaeldelboni/nota/blob/main/resources/config.edn) with your keys or the corresponding enviroment variables.
The config is generated using shadow-cljs hook, macros and [juxt/aero](https://github.com/juxt/aero) under the hood, check it's documentation for more information on how to use.  

_[Aero's #profile](https://github.com/juxt/aero#profile)_ reader conditionals available:
 - `:dev` for when running locally dev builds
 - `:release` for compiled final builds.

## Where is the `index.html`?
The index page is being generated by a custom [shadow-cljs hook](https://github.com/rafaeldelboni/nota/blob/main/src/nota/hooks/index.clj)
all of this to be possible to use [Fingerprint-Hash](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#NameHashing) on the js generated.
